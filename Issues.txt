replacement items have corrupted graphics.

picking up potions/vellums/etc will disable the drop at its original drop location.
update: not quite what's happening, should be able to fix.

potions/vellums/etc needs custom code to exit map.

the hp item doesn't have a disable toggle, so you can keep picking up the replacement item. custom code needed.
