replacement items have corrupted graphics.

the hp item doesn't have a disable toggle, so you can keep picking up the replacement item. custom code needed. i think.

resolve remaining softlocks (stage 6 statues for example)

under rare circumstances, item-location pairing can lock up. example:
No custom seed supplied, generating seed: 1564103277733612200
Item-location pairing process has locked!
Remaining items:
  Earth crest
  Buster
  Water Crest
  Air Crest
  Time Crest
  Tornado
Remaining locations:
  Stage 5 hp (water route)
  Ovnunu
  Stage 2 hp (bone pile)
  Vellum (s3)
  Armor
  Stage 5 hp (above crawler)
